# GDXView

Objective-C library with convenient IB-designable view class.

## Adding GDXView to your project

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add GDXView to your project.

1. Add a pod entry for GDXView to your Podfile `pod 'GDXView'`
2. Update the pod(s) by running `pod update`.
3. Include library files wherever you need it with `#import "GDXView.h"`.

### Source files

Alternatively you can directly add the `GDXView.h` and `GDXView.m` source files to your project.

1. Download the [latest code version](https://github.com/GDXRepo/GDXView/archive/master.zip) or add the repository as a git submodule to your git-tracked project.
2. Open your project in Xcode, then drag and drop `GDXView.h` and `GDXView.m` onto your project (use the "Project Navigator view"). Make sure to select Copy items when asked if you extracted the code archive outside of your project.
3. Include library files wherever you need it with `GDXView.h`.
